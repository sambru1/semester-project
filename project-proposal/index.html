<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  <!--Break-down of elements I want to include-->
  I want to make a website for a bubble tea stand/ restaurant. This establishment doesn’t actually exist, so I can have a little bit of freedom with how I make it and what I add onto it. I will be using images from copyright free websites like “unsplash” and “pexels, and also illustrate elements as I move along with the project. The feel of the project will be light, colourful and fun.
</p>
<h2>CSS elements</h2>
<p>
  I’m not sure what we will be learning for the rest of the semester, so I won’t know what to add for until we learn them. Some things I want to have one my page is:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Drop down selection from nav bar.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hover buttons that display special animations.
  </li>
  <li>
    A carousel of pictures on the main page.
  </li>
  <li>
    A menu, about us, and location page.
  </li>
  <li>
    A logo that might include an animation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Linkws socials on the navigation bar.
  </li>
  <li>
    It will be responsive for large screens and small screens like iphones.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will have the nav bar stick to the top of the screen so users will always be able to direct themselves around.
  </li>
</ul>
<!--Explanation of User Persona and the color pallete I will use-->
<h2>User Persona & Color palette</h2>
<p>
  Bubble tea usually attracts a younger crowd between the ages of 12-25. I wanna make my page look fun and poppy when users come to use it. The colors I have chosen are more on the lighter and pop side. They are subject to change as I move on with my project, but for now I want to go with these.
</p>
<section>
  <!--Color pallete is from "coolers.com"-->

</section>
<h2> Wireframes</h2>
<p>
  I have made up these wireframes to show the direction of I want to go with my website. Like I said before with my color choice, elements of my wireframes are subject to change because I will evolve my website as we learn new things in the program and my thoughts go further.
